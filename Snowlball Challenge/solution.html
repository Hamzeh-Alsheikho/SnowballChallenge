                We have come up with a solution for this problem. At first, we thought that adding a minimum number of floors (3+ for instance) to be able to use the elevator would be a good idea. But after discussing it for a while, we figured out that some people could be a way too lazy than we think. They would probably take the elevator up to the minimum floor and then walk down to the floor of their destination. So instead, we want to program the student/employee cards so that it is connected to the elevator. Every person who has a valid reason that they cannot use the stairs, will have access to the elevator. On the other hand, all the students/employees who are not in need of an elevator, will not have access.
